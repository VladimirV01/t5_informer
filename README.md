# Lilygo T5 Pro Informer for Home Assistant
This repository contains all my relevant materials, configurations and information used at building a Lilygo T5 Pro Informer for Home Assistant, based on ESP32-S3 module.

This project came to life mainly because I wanted to try the ePaper technology and check it out by myself. 
Initially I wanted to buy a bare display and make the electronics myself but I saw the Lilygo module and decided it is going to be faster to just buy it. 

At the moment of the build I had quite some trouble compiling it with ESPHome because the esp32-s3 was not fully supported at that time. As a result I had to to some digging on the internet to find a solution. 

## TODO:
1.  Add config file
2.  Add files for 3D print
3.  Add custom files needed for compile
4.  Add the display layout config file
5.  Add assembly steps with photos
